# HPC-Comperative-Study-Multithreading-MSAProbs

## Overview
This repository contains the PDF of a paper I authored as part of my Master's coursework in Bioinformatics. The work focuses on evaluating the performance of MSAProbs, a tool for multiple sequence alignment, when parallelized using different numbers of threads. Through this project, I gained valuable experience working with High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments, specifically on the Finis Terrae III supercomputer, which has equipped me with the skills to confidently handle HPC systems for bioinformatics research.

## Title
MSAProbs Parallelization for High-Performance Sequence Alignment: A Comparative Study on Multithreading and Time Measures

## Abstract
The paper investigates the computational complexity of sequence alignment and explores how parallelization can enhance the performance of MSAProbs. By leveraging multithreading on the Finis Terrae III supercomputer, the study evaluates runtime metrics and speedup across three datasets of varying sizes. The results show that MSAProbs achieves significant time reductions (up to 97%) and exhibits excellent scalability, making it an efficient tool for high-performance sequence alignment tasks.

## Key Highlights
1) HPC Experience: This project allowed me to work with an HPC environment, including configuring and running bioinformatics tools on a supercomputer.

2) Performance Analysis: Demonstrated how parallelization can drastically reduce computational time for sequence alignment tasks.

3) Scalability: Showed that MSAProbs scales efficiently with increasing threads, making it suitable for large datasets.
